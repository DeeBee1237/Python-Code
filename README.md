# Python-Code
The Python code that I have worked on this year. The most interesting part was the command line based 
chat room that allowed multiple clients to connect to a server from different machines and chat!
The socket programming code was not entirely written by me. This was a project for one of my Networking courses
and a small bit of starter code was given to us to read, understand and extend.
The code that I added actually ensured the chat room would work!
